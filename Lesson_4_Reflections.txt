4.7 When would you want to create a remote Repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-  Keeping work local makes it hard to collaborate with others.
-  Once work in the local Repository is bug-free and Production ready, it makes sense to create a remote version.
-  This remote Repository can then be pushed to a collaborative environment like GitHub.
-  Also, other collaborators will do the same with their local Repositories.
-  In this way the collaborative work with them be hosted on GitHub.
-  Individual developers can then pull the combined Repository to their local machines to do their own testing and further development.

4.10 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-  The value of having remote Repositories is to enable collaboration with other Developers.
-  This means that the remote Repository could contain changes or new code that may not be compatible with your local Repository.
-  Therefore, it is safer to let users manually pull changes from the remote Repository to their local Repository after they have verified that the changes are compatible.
-  Also, automatically pulling in changes every time there is a new commit to the remote Repository could create a lot of extra, unwanted commits, making the Project difficult to track.
-  Furthermore, if the local Repository has multiple active branches and the one currently checked out doesn't exist on the remote Repository, an automatic pull could fail with errors.
-  Similarly, pushing changes from a local Repository to a remote Repository should also be a manual process, ensuring bug-free and compatible code is pushed to a collaborative space.
