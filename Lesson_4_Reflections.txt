4.7 When would you want to create a remote Repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-  Keeping work local makes it hard to collaborate with others.
-  Once work in the local Repository is bug-free and Production ready, it makes sense to create a remote version.
-  This remote Repository can then be pushed to a collaborative environment like GitHub.
-  Also, other collaborators will do the same with their local Repositories.
-  In this way the collaborative work with them be hosted on GitHub.
-  Individual developers can then pull the combined Repository to their local machines to do their own testing and further development.
