Lesson 3 Reflections

3.4 What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

-  A Repository is initialized in Git using the "git init" command.
-  This creates a hidden folder named '.git' in the directory where the command was executed.
-  This folder contains all the metadata associated with a Git Repository.
-  From this point on, all files in the parent directory (and its sub-directories) can be tracked for changes.
-  Without initializing a Repository, Git has no way of tracking history and changes.
-  Initializing does not create a commit, since the user may not want all files within the directory to be added to the Repository.
-  Also, the user wouldn't have the opportunity to add a comment to a commit created upon initialization.
-  Running the "git status" command shows all files that are untracked and available for committing into the Repository.

3.7 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

-  The Working Directory is simply the directory where the user is currently working.
-  The Working Directory is part of the Operating System's file system and not part of Git.
-  A Repository is a collection of files within a parent directory (and its sub-directories) that are tied to single Git instance.
-  A Repository consists of the contents of the working (parent) directory, its sub-directories and the '.git' folder with change history metadata.
-  The Working Directory can contain multiple files with multiple logical changes.
-  The Staging Area provides a temporary stage wherein the user can add changes one logical step at a time, instead of the entire contents of the working directory.
-  Files can be added one a time to the Staging Area using the "git add" command.
-  The user can then check the contents of the Staging Area using the "git status" command to ensure only the desired changes will be committed.
-  The Staging Area provides the option to commit one logical change a time within a large Working Directory.
-  The Staging Area provides the ability to double check the contents of a logical before making a commit.
-  The "git reset" command allows files to be removed from the Staging Area is the contents are too large for a single commit.
